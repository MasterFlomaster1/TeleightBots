## How to contribute
#### **Did you find a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub issue if it's not already reported.

* Explain it clearly, with steps (or code) to reproduce it. 

#### **Why don't some methods exist?**
* Teleight is a fairly new library and some methods may not be available.
* New pull requests adding methods to the library are welcomed.

#### **How to wrap methods and objects from Telegram?**
1. Visit [Telegram Bot Api](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).
2. Take a look at [GetUpdates method](https://github.com/Teleight/TeleightBots/blob/master/src/main/java/org/teleight/teleightbots/api/methods/GetUpdates.java) and [GetUpdates result](https://github.com/Teleight/TeleightBots/blob/master/src/main/java/org/teleight/teleightbots/api/objects/Update.java).
3. Make sure to follow the current syntax and design.
4. Create a pull request.

Feel free to ask for anything, Teleight is a community project not affiliated to Telegram in any way

Thank you! ❤️
